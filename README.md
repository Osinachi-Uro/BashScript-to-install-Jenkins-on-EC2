# BashScript-to-install-Jenkins-on-EC2

[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is the leading open source development and operations automation server, it provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

As a DevOps Engineer, Jenkins has become a necessary tool for Continuous Integration and Deployment, CI/CD and there are different ways to install and configure a Jenkins server.

I have created a simple [bash script](https://github.com/Osinachi-Uro/BashScript-to-install-Jenkins-on-EC2/blob/main/jenkins.sh) that installs Jenkins on an Ubuntu server at startup using the User Data option of AWS EC2.

Here is also an [article](https://dev.to/osinachiuro/how-to-set-up-jenkins-on-an-ec2-instance-using-bashscript-4mgj) that gives a step-by-step guide on how to use the script.
